# PREDICTING RESTAURANT EQUITY PRICES USING AN LSTM
The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the landscape of the restaurant industry. This repository contains a model intended to predict restaurant equity prices for the remainder of the year 2022. Using  projected COVID-19 deaths as an exogenous variable, I use an LSTM to predict future prices. Although the model is limited by the inherent diffculty of predicting COVID deaths, the results were solid. The top 3 best perfomers were**worse** . The worst 3 performers were **worse**

## PROPHET

## LSTM 
Surprisingly, the Prophet model performed better than the LSTM but the  MAPE value are still quite high. However, these results do not compare unfavorably to results found elsewhere:

## PRICE MODELING
Here is a comparison of MAPEs for each equity.


Overall, the results were good. I chose to use the LSTM model because its results were the best except for a few outliers that I will have to approach with caution.
